				<h3>Programming in Python</h3>
				<p>
					Python is a high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose programming language known for its clear and readable syntax. As programming software, Python provides developers with a flexible and powerful environment for writing code efficiently and in an easy-to-understand manner. With a wide variety of libraries and modules available, Python is suitable for a range of applications, from web and scientific development to task automation and artificial intelligence. Its popularity stems from its simplicity, versatility, and large developer community that consistently contributes to the growth and evolution of the language.</p>
				<p>To upload programming to our XIAO-PR2040, we will connect it using a USB C cable while holding down the bootloader mode, which corresponds to the button labeled with a B.</p>
				<div class="align-center">
					<img src="../assets/images/Week06/B03.jpeg" alt="" width="50%"/>
				</div>
				<p>If done correctly, an administrator for our microcontroller should appear on the computer screen.</p>
				<div class="align-center">
					<img src="../assets/images/Week06/B04.jpeg" alt="" width="50%"/>
				</div>
				<p>Download the following document: <b><a href="../assets/files/Week06/adafruit-circuitpython-seeeduino_xiao_rp2040-es-8.2.10.uf2" download>adafruit-circuitpython-seeeduino_xiao_rp2040-es-8.2.10.uf2</a></b></p>
				<p>Paste the file into the window that opened on the microcontroller. Should look like this.</p>
				<div class="align-center">
					<img src="../assets/images/Week06/B09.jpeg" alt="" width="50%"/>
				</div>
				<p>Download and open the <b><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a></b> application. 
					Visual Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) created by Microsoft. It provides developers with a comprehensive set of tools for building various types of software applications, including web applications, mobile apps, desktop programs, cloud services, and games. Visual Studio supports multiple programming languages, including C#, Visual Basic, C++, Python, and more, and it offers features such as code editing, debugging, version control, and project management. It is widely used by developers around the world due to its robust features, extensive ecosystem, and integration with other Microsoft technologies.</p>
				<p>Once the microcontroller is set up in bootloader mode, we can open a folder named CIRCUITPY in the Visual Studio Code program.</p>
				<div class="align-center">
					<img src="../assets/images/Week06/B10.jpeg" alt="" width="45%"/>
					<img src="../assets/images/Week06/B11.jpeg" alt="" width="45%"/>
				</div>
				<br>
				<p>To program, we chose the file named code.py. Every time I save the file, it executes automatically.</p>
				<div class="align-center">
					<img src="../assets/images/Week06/B12.jpeg" alt="" width="60%"/>
				</div>
				<br>
				<p>An important mention is that there is a Python extension that helps us analyze the code, detecting possible syntax errors.</p>
				<div class="align-center">
					<img src="../assets/images/Week06/B13.jpeg" alt="" width="60%"/>
				</div>
				<br>
				<p>Similarly, if you want to open a serial monitor, you need to download the SerialMonitor extension. Serial communication is a method for transferring data between electronic devices by transmitting information sequentially, bit by bit. It is widely used in various applications, from interactions between microcontrollers and sensors to communication between computers and peripherals, due to its simplicity, efficiency, and low resource.</p>
				<div class="align-center">
					<img src="../assets/images/Week06/B14.jpeg" alt="" width="60%"/>
				</div>
				<br>
				<p>To open the serial monitor tab, you must select this option located in the upper right corner.</p>
				<div class="align-center">
					<img src="../assets/images/Week06/B15.jpeg" alt="" width="60%"/>
				</div>
				<br>
				<p>Be careful to select the port of the computer and baud rate. where the microcontroller is connected.</p>
				<div class="align-center">
					<img src="../assets/images/Week06/B16.jpeg" alt="" width="60%"/>
				</div>
				<br>
				<p>Here is an example of how an infinite "Hello world" printout should look in the serial monitor.</p>
				<p>Press <b>Ctrl+S</b> to upload the program and start execution.</p>
				<div class="align-center">
					<img src="../assets/images/Week06/B17.jpeg" alt="" width="60%"/>
				</div>
				<br>
				<p>Now, to add libraries in Python, you need to download the following .zip folder from the following link and decompress.</p>
				<b><a href="https://circuitpython.org/libraries" target="_blank">https://circuitpython.org/libraries</a></b>
				<div class="align-center">
					<img src="../assets/images/Week06/B18.jpeg" alt="" width="60%"/>
				</div>
				<br>
				<p>Both in the microcontroller and in the folder that has just been decompressed, you should open their respective "lib" folders. Due to memory limitations on the card, only pass the libraries that you will use in your program.</p>
				<div class="align-center">
					<img src="../assets/images/Week06/B19.jpeg" alt="" width="44%"/>
					<img src="../assets/images/Week06/B20.jpeg" alt="" width="45%"/>
				</div>
				<br>
				<p>In this case, since we will be programming something similar to Arduino by changing the colors of the NEOPIXEL LED, we will copy that library to the microcontroller.</p>
				<div class="align-center">
					<img src="../assets/images/Week06/B21.jpeg" alt="" width="60%"/>
				</div>
				<div style="overflow:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;border-radius:10px;width:100%;max-width:943px;position:relative"><div style="width:100%;padding-bottom:142.94803817603392%"></div><iframe width="943" height="1348" title="" src="https://snappify.com/embed/6891a7a0-6fb4-4192-bb92-b1c74ed177ae/6310c40d-fd0b-4ca6-9d8a-a15a79880154?responsive=1&b=1" allow="clipboard-write" allowfullscreen="" loading="lazy" style="background:#ffffff00;position:absolute;left:0;top:0;width:100%" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>

				<h2>Conclusion</h2>
				<p>After working with both Arduino and Python programming languages, initially Arduino didn't pose much difficulty for me since it's the one I've typically used. However, as I delved further into Python, I realized it's somewhat simpler. The complexity in Python was having to remember to press the button on the microcontroller for bootloader mode labeled with a B.</p>
