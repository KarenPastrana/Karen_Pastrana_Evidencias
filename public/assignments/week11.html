				<h1>11. Input devices</h1>

				<h2>Research</h2>
				<p>In the realm of computing and technology, an "input" refers to any type of information, data, or 
					signal that enters into a system, program, or electronic device. Inputs are fundamental for 
					computer systems to interact with the environment and process information appropriately. These 
					inputs can come from a wide variety of sources, such as keyboards, mice, microphones, sensors, 
					scanners, among other input devices. The quality and accuracy of inputs directly influence the 
					effectiveness and performance of computer systems, as they constitute the raw material for executing 
					operations and making decisions.</p>

				<p>A touch sensor button, also known as a touch-sensitive button or touchpad, is a type of input device
					 that detects physical touch or pressure to initiate a specific action or command. Unlike traditional
					  mechanical buttons, which require physical depression, touch sensor buttons respond to gentle taps
					   or swipes, providing a more intuitive and user-friendly interface. </p>

				<p>In the following image, you can see an exploded view of a simple touch sensor button. The overlay sits 
					on top. It serves as a separation between the PCB and the user. The thickness of the overlay affects 
					the touch performance. The sensor pad is the crucial element, which is a solid copper pad. If the 
					buttons are smaller, touch sensitivity decreases. If the buttons are too large, they become overly 
					sensitive. The mesh pattern is the ground. The electric field from the sensor pad emerges and 
					terminates at ground. When the button is touched, an alternative path for field lines is provided. 
					This, in turn, reflects an increase in capacitance. The touch controller detects this change in 
					capacitance. To obtain more information about the Grove - Touch Sensor, you can view its <b><a href="https://robu.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Grove-Touch-Sensor.pdf" target="_blank">datasheet</a></b>.</p>

				<p>To operate the touch button for the physical connection, the part called SIG 
					should be connected to pin B2 of the Attiny44, which is marked as 8 in the programming. 
					The other two wires needed are VCC and GND. It is important to mention that for the button, 
					the operating voltage is 2.0 - 5.5V. The Attiny44 operates at a voltage range between 2.7V and 5.5V. </p>

				<p>I used my PCB from <b><a href="https://fabacademy.org/2024/labs/puebla/students/brenda-pastrana/assignments/week08.html" target="_blank">my week 8</a></b> as yo can see in my last picture.</p>
				<p>Here you will find the <b><a href="https://fabacademy.org/2024/labs/puebla/week11/" target="_blank">group assignment</a></b> with a little more information about the inputs.</p>

				<h2>Programming</h2>
				<p>The same as the outputs week, I used an Arduino UNO as a programmer and its software.</p>
				<div class="align-center">
					<img src="../assets/images/Week11/A05.jpeg" alt="" width="70%"/>
				</div>	
				<div style="overflow:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;border-radius:10px;width:100%;max-width:675px;position:relative"><div style="width:100%;padding-bottom:100.2962962962963%"></div><iframe width="675" height="677" title="" src="https://snappify.com/embed/6891a7a0-6fb4-4192-bb92-b1c74ed177ae/f790d7c6-48ac-4fc7-ac68-86b1606ff1f4?responsive=1&b=1" allow="clipboard-write" allowfullscreen="" loading="lazy" style="background:#ffffff00;position:absolute;left:0;top:0;width:100%" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>				
				<p>Because initially I couldn't get the LED to turn on with the code, I decided to implement serial communication to check if the code was working correctly. After confirming that it was indeed working, I realized that I had used the wrong pin in the programming.</p>

				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>
					This week actually felt very similar to the outputs week, although the only difference and issue I encountered is that, because I found it interesting to discover how this sensor worked and I had never used it before, I needed to know how to connect it or if I needed to place a resistor. However, after doing a bit more research and with the documentation from this week, I learned how to obtain its value, but other than that, I didn't have any major issues.</p>
