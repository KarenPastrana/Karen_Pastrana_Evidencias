				<h1>9. Output devices</h1>
				<p>This week I worked on output devices. I used the PCB I made in week 8. For this occasion, I chose 
				to use a 16x2 LCD, although initially, I tried with a speaker, but it seems that was not the most optimal choice.</p>
				<p>Here you will find the <b><a href="https://fabacademy.org/2024/labs/puebla/week9/" target="_blank">group assignment</a></b> with a little more information.</p>

				<h2>Research</h2>
				<p>
					16x2 LCD displays are connected to microcontrollers or embedded systems using various pins, including 
					RS (Register Select) for selecting between data and commands, RW (Read/Write) to indicate whether 
					reading or writing to the display, EN (Enable) to enable communication, and pins D4 to D7 to transmit 
					data on a 4-bit or 8-bit data bus. These connections allow for precise and efficient control of the 
					display and transmission of information for visualization. In terms of power consumption, 16x2 LCD 
					displays typically require between 1 and 2 watts, depending on the backlighting technology used and 
					the configured brightness.</p>
				<p>
					A potentiometer needs to be connected to an LCD screen to adjust the contrast
					 and enable clear visibility of the displayed text. This adjustment is necessary because the backlight 
					 intensity and screen contrast may vary depending on environmental conditions and device settings. 
					 By adjusting the potentiometer, the voltage applied to the screen can be modified, allowing for finding 
					 the optimal contrast level for clear and legible text display under different lighting conditions.</p>
				
				<h2>What I learned from interfacing output divices</h2>	 
				<p>As I mentioned, I used my PCB from <b><a href="https://fabacademy.org/2024/labs/puebla/students/brenda-pastrana/assignments/week08.html" target="_blank">my week 8</a></b>.</p>
				<p>For the programming part, I used the Arduino software. To upload programs to the Attiny44, I utilized an Arduino UNO as a programmer, along with the following configurations.</p>

				<div style="overflow:hidden;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;border-radius:10px;width:100%;max-width:1082.12px;position:relative"><div style="width:100%;padding-bottom:74.02136546778547%"></div><iframe width="1082.12" height="801" title="" src="https://snappify.com/embed/6891a7a0-6fb4-4192-bb92-b1c74ed177ae/c5043381-9e04-490e-b71b-aa6963b99201?responsive=1&b=1" allow="clipboard-write" allowfullscreen="" loading="lazy" style="background:#ffffff00;position:absolute;left:0;top:0;width:100%" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>

				<p>For this week, I used:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>2 resistors 0 ohms</li>
					<li>PCB Attiny 44</li>
					<li>6x2 LCD screen</li>
					<li>Potentiometer</li>
					<li>220 Ohm resistor</li>
				</ul>
				<p>This week I faced complications; I spent the entire day trying to figure out why it wasn't working. 
					I thought it was due to my connections, even changing the pins I connected the LCD to about 5 times, 
					but it still didn't work. The screen would only display brightness without showing any letters, even 
					though I had a potentiometer. Additionally, I realized that I hadn't connected enough voltage and 
					ground pins.</p>
				<div class="align-center">
					<img src="../assets/images/Week09/A01.jpeg" alt="" width="60%"/>
				</div>
				<p>Later on, I realized that I had forgotten to connect the RW pin of the LCD. Although I highly doubted 
				that was the issue because some internet pages mentioned it was optional and could be connected to 
				power, I went from having a screen with only boxes to one displaying letters. Therefore, I highly 
				recommend not getting frustrated when things don't work out and continuing to investigate.</p>

				</div>
				<p>On the other hand, the first option I had was to work with a speaker, and I thought it would be the 
				same as using a buzzer but with a transistor to amplify the sound. However, although it did emit 
				sound, it wasn't what I expected. I have the theory that what wasn't working properly was the speaker 
				because I was powering it with a square 9V battery, but it still didn't sound good. The song I wanted
					to play was the Imperial March from Star Wars.</p>
				<p>
					The transistor I was using was the BC547B, which is an NPN transistor suitable for use in audio 
					amplifier input and output stages. However, this might have been the mistake as it could have been 
					the wrong transistor for the job.</p>
