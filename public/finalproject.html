				<h2>What does it do?</h2>
				<p>By using mechanical displays, it can change the numbers to show the Pomodoro method, as well as display the time on an OLED screen and show the weather.</p>

				<h2>Who’s done what beforehand?</h2>
				<p>I haven't found anyone who has made a mechanical clock with the Pomodoro method. What I have seen recently 
					is that people have been designing mechanical 7-segment displays. For example, a guy who calls himself JBC 
					Creative uploaded a mechanical 7-segment display. <b><a href="https://twitter.com/jbvcreative/status/1780356814170718312?s=48" target="_blank">Rack Driven 7 Segment Display</a></b>, but in my opinion, it is too wide, and he sells his design. 
					Later, he joined six of these to make a clock that moves with motors. After researching more to understand the 
					functioning of the gears, I noticed that the same guy uploaded an even thinner display, but he hasn't shared 
					that design <b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/pGf1Ritfatg" target="_blank">Mecanical 7 Segment Display</a></b>. However, by investigating more on the internet, I found a free-use 7-segment display by the author 			
					Flower-3D, although his design is manual, meaning if you want to change the number, you have to press a button 
					yourself. <b><a href="https://www.printables.com/en/model/860058-7-segment-mechanical-counter-version-21-ratchet-wi" target="_blank">7 Segment Mechanical Counter</a></b></p>
				<p>There are some problems with the design of Flower-3D, for example, the segments do not completely hide or at certain points, the numbers are not fully visible because the gears did not move correctly.</p>

				<h2>What did you design?</h2>
				<p>I designed the casing to hold everything in MDF. I also designed the PCB to control all the motors and sensors used.</p>
				<h2>What materials and components were used?</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>PLA for 3D printing the mechanical displays and casing.</li>
					<li>MDF for the casing.</li>
					<li>NEMA 17 stepper motors.</li>
					<li>A4988 stepper motor driver modules.</li>

					<li>OLED screen.</li>
					<li>RTC DS3231 module.</li>
					<li>Button.</li>
					<li>220 ohm resistors.</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>Where did they come from?</h2>
				<p>Materials such as the Xiao ESP32C3, PLA, and MDF were provided by FabLab Puebla. The OLED screen and motors were sourced from local suppliers in Puebla, or alternatively, they were acquired through online stores like Mercado Libre and Amazon</p>

				<h2>Clock with a Pomodoro timer and weather</h2>
				<p>The idea of this project is to have a clock with different functionalities so that you can better organize yourself with the Pomodoro Technique. The concept is that with a button, you can switch between clock function and the technique, and possibly also connect an interface that allows you to do so from a device. It would also feature a screen displaying the room's climate and, through an API, be able to view the weather of the city you are in.</p>
				<p>Previously, the idea was to use one motor for each numeric segment, totaling 42 motors for the clock, but this was clearly not practical. After some research, I found that mechanical 7-segment displays exist. I used one of these as a test, but its design required manually pressing a button to change the numbers. I decided to improve this model so that it has better functionality and can be adapted to implement one motor, allowing the clock to work.</p>

				<h2>Research</h2>
				
				<p>The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It involves breaking work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. The technique aims to improve productivity by promoting focus and reducing the impact of distractions. Named after the Italian word for 'tomato' (pomodoro) due to the use of a tomato-shaped kitchen timer by Cirillo during his university years, the Pomodoro Technique has gained popularity as a simple yet effective approach to managing time and tasks.</p> 
				<p>One of the ideas that I'm liking a lot is being able to design something like what can be seen in the following link:</p>
				<b><a href="https://twitter.com/jbvcreative/status/1780356814170718312?s=48" target="_blank">Rack Driven 7 Segment Display</a></b>
				<br>
				<br>
				<h2>Progress</h2>
				<p>For these initial tests, I am displaying the values obtained by the RTC DS3231 module (temperature and stored time) on an OLED screen. All of this is connected via I2C communication to the XIAO ESP32C3 microcontroller. To make the RTC module work, it needs a 3V clock battery so that it retains the time even when it is not receiving enough power to stay on, and it does not need to be reconfigured each time it is turned on. </p>
				<p>In the video, you can see how the data for the advancing seconds is stored.</p>

					<h2>What questions need to be answered?</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>How to make a better mechanism performance for the 7-segment display?</li>
						<li>Can a mechanism for the 6 segments be assembled?</li>
						<li>How convenient is it to 3D print the parts? Is laser cutting more convenient?</li>
						<li>If cut in MDF, will it wear out?</li>
						<li>What speed can the mechanism withstand?</li>
						<li>How difficult will it be to establish communication with an API to get the location, local time, and weather?</li>
					</ul>
	
					<h2>How will it be evaluated?</h2>
					<ol>
						<li>Function as a clock</li>
						<li>Function as a Pomodoro timer</li>
						<li>Switch between clock and Pomodoro timer modes</li>
						<li>Display the room temperature</li>
						<li>Display the city's temperature</li>
					</ol>

			
				<h2>What has worked? What hasn't?</h2>
				<p>So far, the function of mechanically changing the numbers for the clock part has been a bit difficult, but it is still in progress and I need to program it to change the numbers.</p>
				<p>On the other hand, I made a case to place everything, but it didn't fit perfectly, so I need to redesign it.</p>
				<p>I also had cut the PCB, but due to a small unevenness, some tracks were eaten up, so I need to redo it.</p>

				<h2>What questions need to be resolved?</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>How can I make a coupler that adjusts better and has more force to turn the motor?</li>
					<li>How to obtain variables to indicate the number of steps the mechanical number should advance?</li>
					<li>How can I include the weather API?</li>

					<li>(16) - Type #31 rubber band (3mm x 60mm)</li>
				</ul>
				<p>To assemble each mechanical 7-segment display, you can follow the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5hJP_6xUcU" target="_blank">Flower-3D tutorial</a>. 
					Keep in mind that you only have the parts I provided for download <a href="assets/files/FinalProject/Display de 7 segmentos.zip" download>7_Segment_Display.zip</a>, and they are not the same 
					quantity as explained in the video. You will finish assembling when you reach minute 9:32 of 
					the video by placing the screws in the corresponding holes. Another important point is the way 
					the bands are placed for the segments. In my design, you use 3 bands to reduce resistance. It 
					should look like this: </p>

					</div>
				<p><b>Important note:</b> I recommend using some type of lubricant for the gears and the segment flowers, 
					as reducing the resistance on the gears will make it easier for the motor to move the necessary 
					steps to advance to the next number. Each number corresponds to a 20° rotation.</p>

					accommodate the Xiao ESP32C3, four A4988 stepper motor driver modules, PCF8574 I2C GPIO Expander 
					Module, OLED screen, RTC DS3231 module, and a button. I used KiCad to design my PCB and the ROLAND SRM-20 
					machine to create the PCB on a 10 cm x 15 cm phenolic board.</p>

				<h2>Programming</h2>
				<p>For the programming part, since we are using the RTC DS3231 module, the first thing we need to do is insert a 3V 
					battery into the module. After connecting everything, we upload the <a href="assets/files/FinalProject/Reajuste_HORA/Reajuste_HORA.ino" download>Reajuste_HORA.ino</a> program. This step is crucial 
					to set the current time in the module's memory. With this setup, even if the PCB is disconnected from the computer 
					or its power source, the module won't forget the time as it has its own battery. The code was modified from 
					<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdWd5Sn7nDg" target="_blank">ChepeCarlos</a>.</p>
				<p>Afterwards, if you want to test that all your motors and the screen are working 100%, you can upload the following code: 
					<a href="assets/files/FinalProject/Pnatalla_RTC_Motores_Pruebas/Pnatalla_RTC_Motores_Pruebas.ino" download>Pantalla_RTC_Motores_Pruebas.ino</a>.</p>
