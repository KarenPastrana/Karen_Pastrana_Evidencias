				<h1>My Final Project</h1>
				<!-- <h2>F1 race track where you can see in real time the location of the cars.</h2> -->
				<h2>Taekwondo electronic breastplate</h2>
				<!-- <p>The idea started seeing that with the Apple Vision Pro is promoted that you can see in real time the F1
					 race, and I find it very interesting idea, although the detail is that only the person who is using
					  the device will be the only person who can see the race, then I thought that maybe with projectors
					   style lamps that were attached to the corners of the table could do the same and thus to see with 
					   several people at once the race and feel that emotion.  </p> -->
				<p>The idea of creating an electronic breastplate to be able to train in the sport of taekwondo is because 
					it is not usually a cheap and easy to get equipment. The Universidad Ibero Puebla last year went
					 to compete in a competition called CONADEIP, where several private institutions in Mexico 
					 participate, but because it is not usually train with this type of equipment, it was very difficult
					  when trying to get the points because the sensors are only found at certain points, plus in the 
					  competition they ask everyone to bring their electronic bibs that besides being expensive, were out
					   of stock. Here is a picture of my younger sister with the equipment on to start her combat.</p>

				</div>
				<p>So, the idea of my project is to create a breastplate that has the sensors and allows us to have a way to train more 
					appropriate and thus get results of what we should focus on to get better results, as well as the interface
					 to be able to visualize the results. Probably the sensors that would be used are pressure and bluetooth.</p>
				<!-- <p>But being a project with too much complexity, talking with Professor Rafa Perez, he proposed me to make a kind 
					of laser cut model that would be modular and thus be able to change it as the race tracks change, and have 
					something that can move the cars in real time to locate them exactly, for this I will need the Formula 1 data sets.</p> -->

				<h2>Research</h2>
				<h3>Some of the problems of the current breastplate:</h3>
				<p>The problem lies in the fact that electronic breastplate are very sensitive and register very slight impacts
					 such as a simple rub or even a strong wind push and mark them in the score.</p>
				<p>They are heavy and present in all major taekwondo competitions.
					They do not have sensors all over the bib, so sometimes they do not mark a kick that clearly went in.</p> 
				<h3>Advantages</h3>
				<p>Judges are impartial and there are fewer errors in the counting of points.</p>
				<p>Record the power of a stroke.</p>
